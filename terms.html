      <h1>GLOBUK Grants:  Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <div class="meta small">Effective date: May 6, 2024</div>

      <div class="notice">
        These Terms and Conditions govern your access to and use of the GLOBUK Grants platform. Read them carefully. By creating an account, submitting an application, or
        otherwise using the Platform you agree to these Terms.
      </div>

      <section>
        <h2>1. About GLOBAL UNITED KINGDOM Grants</h2>
        <p>GLOBUK Grants is a technology platform that enables applicants to submit grant appeals and
        supporting documentation for review and potential funding. GLOBUK Grants facilitates
        application intake, identity verification, document collection, administrative review, and
        payment disbursement where applicable. GLOBUK Grants is not a bank or a financial institution.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Eligibility & Account Information</h2>
        <p>By using the Platform you represent and warrant that you are legally capable of entering
        into binding contracts in your jurisdiction and that the information you provide during
        registration and onboarding is complete, accurate and up to date. You must promptly update
        any material changes to your information. Accounts are for individual use only unless we
        have explicitly agreed otherwise in writing.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Purpose & Permitted Use</h2>
        <p>The Platform is available only for lawful grant-seeking and grant-administration purposes.
        You agree not to use the Platform for any fraudulent, unlawful, or prohibited activities,
        including but not limited to money laundering, identity fraud, or other illicit conduct.
        GLOBUK reserves the right to suspend or close accounts that violate these Terms or applicable law.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Fees — Processing & Verification (Transparent 10% Fee)</h2>
        <p>GLOBUK charges a processing and verification fee of <strong>10% of the requested grant amount</strong>
        (the "Platform Fee") in order to cover operational costs associated with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>identity verification and anti-fraud checks;</li>
          <li>document and eligibility review by trained staff;</li>
          <li>secure infrastructure, storage, and encryption for applicant data;</li>
          <li>payments processing and coordination with banking partners or disbursement agents;</li>
          <li>customer support and dispute handling.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All fees are displayed to you before you confirm any payment or consent to a charge. Fees
        are non-refundable except where GLOBUK expressly states otherwise or where required by
        applicable law.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. How Fees are Collected</h2>
        <p>In many cases GLOBUK collects the Platform Fee by coordinating with local partners or by
        including it in the disbursement calculation; in some programs the applicant may remit the
        fee through a payment link or an accepted payment method shown during checkout. GLOBUK will
        never charge a fee without showing the amount and obtaining your explicit confirmation.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- NEW: Disbursement Process 1,2,3 -->
      <section>
        <h2>5.1 Disbursement Process (How payments are sent)</h2>
        <p>When an application is approved, GLOBUK follows a standard, verifiable disbursement process to ensure funds
        are delivered securely to the intended recipient. The typical steps are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Verification & scheduling.</strong> After approval GLOBUK’s finance team performs final
            verification (identity, account ownership, and any program-specific checks). Once verified, the payment
            is scheduled. Applicants will receive a notification with the scheduled payment date (generally within
            <strong>2–5 business days</strong> of final approval, subject to banking cutoffs and verification).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Method selection & transfer.</strong> Funds are disbursed only to the verified bank account or
            verified digital payment account you provided during onboarding. Depending on the recipient’s country and
            program settings, disbursement may be executed by one of the following methods:
            <ul>
              <li>domestic bank transfer to the verified account;</li>
              <li>an international transfer via our trusted payment partners (for cross-border payments); or</li>
              <li>a coordinated payout through an approved remittance or wallet provider where available.</li>
            </ul>
            GLOBUK will select the method that is appropriate for the recipient’s region and that minimizes cost and delay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Confirmation & reconciliation.</strong> Once the transfer is initiated, GLOBUK will confirm
            initiation and provide a reference or transaction ID where available. Recipients should allow banking
            partner processing times; GLOBUK is not responsible for delays caused by intermediary banks or third-party
            providers. If a payment fails (for example, due to incorrect account details), GLOBUK will notify the
            recipient and work to correct or reschedule the transfer after the recipient provides the required
            corrected information.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="small">Important notes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Payments will only be made to verified accounts that belong to the approved recipient. GLOBUK will not
          disburse funds to accounts that cannot be demonstrated to be controlled by the recipient.</li>
          <li>Where local regulation or program rules require additional steps (e.g. tax forms, business verification),
          payment may be withheld until the required information is provided.</li>
          <li>GLOBUK will provide a clear record of each disbursement (amount, method, and reference) in the Platform
          transaction history and via email notification.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Identity Verification & Compliance</h2>
        <p>To protect applicants and recipients and to comply with legal obligations, GLOBUK may
        require government identification, proof of address, business documents, source-of-funds
        information, and other materials. You consent to GLOBUK performing checks that include
        electronic identity verification, sanctions and watchlist screening, and transaction
        monitoring. Refusal to provide required materials may result in application suspension or
        rejection.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Application Review & Decisions</h2>
        <p>Submission of an application does not guarantee funding. Applications are reviewed
        according to published eligibility criteria. Decisions are final except where GLOBUK
        identifies a clerical error or procedural issue; in such cases GLOBUK may reopen an
        application for correction. Timing for review will vary; applicants will be notified of
        outcomes and next steps through the Platform or by email.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Data, Privacy & Security</h2>
        <p>GLOBUK collects and processes personal data in order to provide the Platform and to meet
        legal and regulatory obligations. We store and transmit data securely and use reasonable
        technical and organizational measures. We may share information with third-party service
        providers who perform services on our behalf (verification vendors, payment processors,
        or legal advisors). Please review our Privacy Policy for details about data retention,
        cross-border transfers, and your rights regarding personal data.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>9. Refunds, Disputes & Corrections</h2>
        <p>If you believe a fee has been charged in error or an application decision was made in
        error, contact GLOBUK Support promptly with documentary evidence. GLOBUK will investigate
        claims in good faith and provide remedies where appropriate. Refund eligibility is handled
        on a case-by-case basis and may be subject to deduction for costs incurred (for example,
        verification vendor fees) unless otherwise agreed.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>10. Limitations of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, GLOBUK and its officers, employees, agents and
        service providers will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or
        special damages arising out of use of the Platform. GLOBUK’s aggregate liability for direct
        damages shall be limited to the greater of (a) the total fees paid by you to GLOBUK with
        respect to the affected application in the six (6) months prior to the event giving rise
        to the claim, or (b) one hundred United States dollars (USD $100), except where local law
        requires a different cap.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>11. Suspension, Termination & Law Enforcement</h2>
        <p>GLOBUK may suspend or terminate accounts, freeze disbursements, or disclose information to
        competent authorities where required by law, regulation, or in response to credible
        indications of unlawful activity. GLOBUK will comply with valid legal process and will
        notify users as permitted by law.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>12. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>We encourage users to use our in-app support channels first. If a dispute cannot be
        resolved informally, parties may pursue mediation or arbitration as set out in the Platform’s
        dispute policy. Any mandatory dispute procedures will be clearly described at the point of
        service or in the application materials for a specific program.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>GLOBUK may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be notified to
        registered users in the Platform or by email. Continued use of the Platform after notice of
        changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>14. Contact & Support</h2>
        <p>If you have questions, require assistance, or wish to raise a complaint regarding an
        application, please contact GLOBUK Support through the in-app support feature or by email
